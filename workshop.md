#  Building Accountable and Transparent RL

**This RLDM 2022  Workshop is on Saturday June 11th from 1:00-5:00pm EST.**

## Motivation

When RL is used in societally relevant domains, practitioners must balance contested values, while anticipating and responding to resulting downstream effects. 
This will require documenting the behavior of RL systems over time, both in relation to design choices and dynamic effects. 
In this workshop, we will survey existing approaches to AI documentation, discuss the unique challenges posed by RL deployments, and introduce a proposal for "Reward Reports": living documents that demarcate design choices and track system behavior. 
The majority of the workshop will be interactive, with participants trying out and critiquing methods of documentation for real or imagined RL applications.

To learn more about Reward Reports, see the [Reward Reports paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10817), the [CLTC RL Risks Whitepaper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05716), or the [github repo](https://github.com/RewardReports/reward-reports) with a template.

## Format -- The (Un)Workshop

We intend for this workshop to be a generative and interactive space for participants to try out and critique our Reward Reports proposal. As such, activities will be centered around doing and sharing in small groups, punctuated by periodic larger group discussions. We hope that by the end of the workshop, there will be two concrete outputs: a rich set of example RRs, and a list of refinements for the Reward Reports framework.

## Agenda

- *1-1:45pm* Introduction
    - Welcome and ice breaker
    - Introduction to documentation and lessons learned from deployed systems
- *1:45-4pm* Participatory deep dive on real-world applications
    - Brainstorm dynamic harms
    - Interactive documentation exercise
    - Break
    - Articulate an oversight agenda for RL systems (e.g. changelog, impact assessments)
- *4-5pm* Reflections and agenda setting
    - Identify missing documentation components / features
    - Propose application-specific protocols
    - Interpret documentation in the context of RL / AI governance
