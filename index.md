# Overview

When RL is used in societally relevant domains, practitioners must balance contested values, while anticipating and responding to resulting downstream effects. 
This will require documenting the behavior of RL systems over time, both in relation to design choices and dynamic effects. 
In this workshop, we will survey existing approaches to AI documentation, discuss the unique challenges posed by RL deployments, and introduce a proposal for “Reward Reports”: living documents that demarcate design choices and track system behavior. 
The majority of the workshop will be interactive, with participants trying out and critiquing methods of documentation for real or imagined RL applications.


We began addressing these issues as part of the [2020 Simons Institute program on the Theory of Reinforcement Learning](https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/mapping-political-economy-reinforcement-learning-systems-case-autonomous-vehicles), and throughout 2020/21 we have been broadening the discussion through an [ongoing reading group](https://geesegraduates.org/2020/10/26/political-economy-of-reinforcement-learning/), including perspectives from Law and Policy.
The aim of this workshop will be to establish a common language around the state of the art of RL across key societal domains.
From this examination, we hope to identify specific interpretive gaps that can be elaborated or filled by members of our community.
Our ultimate goal will be to map near-term societal concerns and indicate possible cross-disciplinary avenues towards addressing them.
